You are an expert at designing structured interviews.

Given the following raw text in {lang}, do the following:
1. Summarize the topic with a short title (max 3-4 words).
2. Write a short second-person description to show the respondent what the interview will cover (1-2 sentences).
3. Write a short thank-you message in a respectful tone. Thank the respondent for their time and focus on the questions. Avoid flattery. Keep it under 20 words.
4. Write 7 deep, thoughtful interview questions that comprehensively cover the core ideas, events, and implications of the text.
5. For each question, write a multilayered expected answer - a short paragraph (max 330 characters) that touches on the key facts, reasoning, and context a well-informed respondent should mention.

Return the result as JSON in this format:

{{
  "language": "{lang}",
  "display_name": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "thank_you_text": "...",
  "questions": [
    {{

      "expected": "..."
    }},
